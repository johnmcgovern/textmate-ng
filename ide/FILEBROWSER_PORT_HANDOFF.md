# FileBrowser port — handoff

_Written 2026-08-15 at the end of the session that ported the whole FileBrowser
view layer and the entire `FileItem*` model family to Swift, and updated later
the same day when `FileBrowserView` finished the view layer. This is the
starting point for a fresh session; the per-commit detail and the reasoning
behind each decision live in `ide/FILEBROWSER_PORT_PLAN.md`, and the 22
cross-framework rules that predate this work are at the end of
`ide/FIND_PORT_HANDOFF.md`. Read those two first. Everything below was measured,
not assumed._

## State you are starting from

- `master`, HEAD `53638c07`, tree clean.
- **620 tests across 36 bundles, green.** Re-measure, never increment — that
  figure has been wrong in these docs before (rule 10). FileBrowser has **9** test
  files (`Frameworks/FileBrowser/tests/t_*.mm`); the framework had **zero** before
  this port began.
- The **first thing settled** was the survey's open question: `FileBrowserViewController`
  **is** constructible in a test process. So this framework's coverage can use
  instances.

### What is already Swift

The entire view layer and the whole `FileItem*` model family:

`OFBHeaderView`, `OFBActionsView`, `FileBrowserOutlineView`, `OFBFinderTagsChooser`,
`FileItemTableCellView`, `FileBrowserView`, `FileItem` (base),
`FileItemMountedVolumes`, `FileItemSCMStatus`, `FileItemObserver`.

### What is still ObjC++ (and why)

- **Ports still to do:** `FileBrowserDiskOperations.mm` (530) and
  `FileBrowserViewController.mm` (2328, the big one — do it last).
- **ObjC++ by design (do not "finish" these without reason):**
  - `FSEventsManager.mm`, `SCMManager.mm` — model managers whose C++ boundaries
    were already made Swift-importable (`FSEventStream`, `SCMManagerCxx`). A Swift
    translation is *optional*; they work as-is behind C++-free headers.
  - The `*Support` / `*Cxx` / globals files that hold C++ or exported globals on
    purpose: `FSEventStream.mm`, `SCMManagerCxx.h`, `FileItemLocations.mm`,
    `FileItemSCMStatusSupport.mm`, `FileItemObserverSupport.mm`,
    `FileBrowserOutlineViewKeyBindings.mm`, `FileBrowserNotifications.mm`
    (the notification-name `extern` consts — rule 19).

## Build, test, run

```bash
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 RUBYOPT="-EUTF-8"
export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH"
ruby ide/extract_specs.rb > ide/gen/specs.json && ruby ide/seed_xcodeproj.rb   # re-seed after adding/removing files
xcodebuild test -project TextMate.xcodeproj -scheme AllTests -configuration Debug            # full suite
xcodebuild test -project TextMate.xcodeproj -scheme AllTests -configuration Debug -only-testing:FileBrowserTests   # just this framework
xcodebuild -project TextMate.xcodeproj -target TextMate -configuration Release build         # the app
open -a "$PWD/build/Release/TextMate-NG.app" <some-git-repo>                                  # run it
```

Re-seeding is needed when a source file is **added or removed** (a `.mm`→`.swift`
swap counts) **and every time a test file's contents change** — see rule 29.
Editing an existing `src/` file does not need it.

**Run the app, every time (rule 8, and it earned its keep again).** The
FileItemObserver port compiled, passed all 617 tests, and showed an **empty
directory** in the running browser because of a weak/strong ownership flip no test
reached (rule 27 below). Open a git repo with modified/deleted/untracked/staged
files and a Finder tag, and check: the list populates, SCM badges and tag dots
draw, a shell-created file live-reloads, the SCM button shows Uncommitted/Untracked,
Computer shows the host + volumes, and rename selects the basename.

## The next ports, specifically

- **`FileBrowserDiskOperations.mm` (530), do first.** A category on `FileBrowserViewController`
  (`performOperation:…`), so it stays paired with the controller. It calls
  `FileItem`/`fileItemWithURL:` (now Swift — fine via the hand-decl) and sets
  `parent.children`. 4 C++ hits per the survey — expect a small `-Cxx`/support
  split (rule 25). The two `performOperation:` selectors are pinned by the
  constructibility test already.
- **`FileBrowserViewController.mm` (2328), last.** The survey's known hazards
  still stand and are the reason it is last:
  - **Rule 21 cascade on `FileBrowserViewController.h`.** `DocumentWindow`'s
    bridging header imports `<FileBrowser/FileBrowserViewController.h>`, and this
    framework's own bridging header must not reach it once Swift defines the class.
    The `FBOperation` NS_OPTIONS (line 58) and the notification names need the
    FindTypes.h-style split; `FileBrowserNotifications.h` already isolates the
    notification consts.
  - **`- (std::map<std::string,std::string>)variables` is pinned from outside**
    (`DocumentWindowSupport.mm:356`). It cannot change shape — it belongs on an
    ObjC++ category on the Swift class, exactly like `DocumentWindowController`'s
    four C++-typed selectors. The selector-surface test already lists it.
  - It is a `<QLPreviewPanelDataSource>` and holds the history/undo state; survey
    its bindings (`grep 'bind:\|addObserver:.*forKeyPath:\|keyPathsForValuesAffecting'`)
    before porting and make every observed property `@objc dynamic` (rule 1).

## Rules earned this session (continuing FIND_PORT_HANDOFF's list at 23)

23. **Keep a ported class's `.h` as a hand-written ObjC declaration of the Swift
    class.** For a class Swift now defines but ObjC++ still consumes (or subclasses,
    or tests), the `DocumentWindowController.h` arrangement is the default here:
    the `.h` declares the class, consumers `#import` it unchanged, and it is kept
    **out of the Swift bridging header** (importing both spellings is a
    redefinition). Nothing checks the `.h` against the Swift at build time — a
    drift is an unrecognized selector at runtime, which is what the
    `instancesRespondToSelector:` tests (rule 18) guard. FileBrowser has no
    module/class-name collision (no class is named `FileBrowser`), so it *could*
    self-import `FileBrowser-Swift.h` like OakAppKit — the hand-decl is a choice
    for zero consumer churn and testability, not a workaround.

24. **`+load`/`+initialize` registries can't be Swift — convert to explicit,
    lazy registration first, in its own ObjC++ commit.** The `FileItem*` family
    self-registered URL schemes from `+load`, which Swift never runs. Replacing it
    with `+registerBuiltinClasses` (dispatch_once, from the single reader, using
    `NSClassFromString` — safe because `-ObjC` keeps the classes linked) is a
    behaviour-preserving prep step the suite + app validate, and it unblocks the
    whole family. Boundary-then-translation, same as the FSEvents/SCM extractions.

25. **Model files want the `-Cxx`/support-file split, not a hand-decl `.h`.**
    A view class ports whole; a model file usually has one C++ fragment (an scm
    map walk, a `path::` call) surrounded by ObjC. Move that fragment **verbatim**
    (rule 6) into a small ObjC++ `…Support` class with a C++-free signature, put
    its header in the bridging header, and the rest becomes Swift.
    `FileItemSCMStatusSupport` / `FileItemObserverSupport` are the worked examples.

26. **Swift 6: a class that hops off the main thread and back cannot capture
    non-Sendable `self`.** The whole browser is main-thread, so mark such classes
    `@MainActor` (which makes them Sendable), run only the *work* in a **file-scope
    `nonisolated async` function** the `@MainActor` code `await`s, and apply the
    result on the main actor. `DispatchQueue.global{…self…}`, `Task.detached{…self…}`,
    and `Task{} + MainActor.run` all fail the sending checks; the await-a-nonisolated-
    function shape is the one that compiles. `@MainActor` deinit teardown runs
    inside `MainActor.assumeIsolated`; a mutable static that matches an
    unsynchronised ObjC++ original is `nonisolated(unsafe)`.

27. **Preserve ObjC ownership exactly — do not "improve" a weak/strong choice.**
    `URLObserverClient.urlObserver` was strong in the ObjC++ (no `weak`), because
    the shared observer is only weakly held by its registry and the client — held
    by the browser — is its real owner. Making it `weak` in Swift deallocated the
    observer before its async load delivered, and **the directory silently showed
    empty** while every test stayed green. Read the `@property` attributes; a
    missing `weak` is load-bearing.

28. **The objcxx importer renames, and the pattern isn't uniform — let the build
    tell you, then record it.** Seen this session: `getter=isX`/`hasX` needs
    per-accessor `@objc(name)` (rule 4) or consumers using the property name
    break; a factory class method imports as an initializer
    (`+imageNamed:inSameBundleAsClass:` → `NSImage(named:inSameBundleAsClass:)`);
    an `extern NSNotificationName const` drops its `Notification` suffix
    (`…MouseDidEnterNotification` → `.OakRolloverButtonMouseDidEnter`); a **C++
    default argument is not imported** so every arg must be passed
    (`OakCreateActionPopUpButton(false)`); and `…AtURL:`/`…ForURL:` selectors trim
    the trailing `URL` inconsistently (`repositoryAtURL:` → `repository(at:)` but
    `addObserverToRepositoryAtURL:usingBlock:` → `addObserverToRepository(at:usingBlock:)`).

The next two are from `FileBrowserView` (`53638c07`). Neither is about Swift —
both are ways this repo's test harness lies to you.

29. **Editing a test file needs a re-seed.** `seed_xcodeproj.rb` **inlines** every
    `tests/t_*.mm` into `ide/gen/tests/<Bundle>_impl.mm` (with `#line` directives,
    which is why failures still point at your file). Only that generated file is
    in the project, so after editing a test `xcodebuild` finds nothing changed,
    silently re-runs **the previous build's test code**, and reports the same
    failure at the same line — which reads as "my fix did nothing". Re-run
    `extract_specs.rb` + `seed_xcodeproj.rb` after any test edit, not just after
    adding or removing files.

30. **`to_s()` on an `NSString*` does not work in an ObjC++ test bundle** unless
    `ns.h` is in scope, and nothing warns you. `ide/xctest_preamble.h` defines a
    generic `to_s(_T const& container)` that for-in-enumerates its argument; with
    `ns.h`'s `to_s(NSString*)` absent it binds to that template, compiles clean,
    and dies at runtime with
    `-[__NSCFConstantString countByEnumeratingWithState:objects:count:]:
    unrecognized selector` pointing at `xctest_preamble.h`, not at your test.
    `OakAppKit`'s tests get `ns.h` from their PCH; FileBrowser's do not. Compare
    strings with `-isEqualToString:` inside `OAK_ASSERT` instead.

## One build gotcha that is not a code error

Ad-hoc CodeSign of **unrelated** test bundles sometimes fails with
`invalid or unsupported format for signature` on a leftover `.cstemp` after many
incremental `xcodebuild test` runs. Clear it and re-run — do not go looking for a
code cause:

```bash
DD=/Users/jmcgovern/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/TextMate-foaewfrsjpmklbgasgjrtfprpoyn
find "$DD/Build/Products" -name '*.cstemp' -delete
xattr -cr "$DD/Build/Products/Debug"
```
